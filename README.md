# Fish Eat Fish

## Overview
Fish Eat Fish is a single-player arcade-style game set in the vast ocean. Players start as the smallest fish in the sea, aiming to become the largest by consuming plankton and other smaller fish. With every bite, the player grows in size and gains points, allowing them to take on larger prey. The game challenges players with its simple yet strategic gameplay, requiring careful navigation of the ocean depths to avoid larger predators while seeking out the next meal.

## How to Play
- Use the **Arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right)** to navigate your fish through the ocean.
- Begin your journey as the smallest fish with 0 points.
- Eat plankton to gain points. Each plankton is worth 1 point.
- As you accumulate points, your size increases, allowing you to consume larger fish.
- You can only eat fish smaller than yourself, as indicated by your fish points.
- Beware of larger fish! As you grow, some fish will try to escape your grasp.
- The game progresses with the ocean becoming more densely populated with various sizes of fish, increasing the challenge.
